Metalanguage for calling Python and potentially other languages

Syntax:

# means comments, or or ### comment ####

Python(PathToFile) calls a python file

Class, String, Tags, Function are explicit tags, rest is derived implictly, python style
"=" is same as newline and pythonline indent, "," is same as newline, () is for more readable grouping

"a = b,c,d" is same as "a = (b,c,d)" which is also same as pythonlike newlines and indenting:
a 
 	b
	c
	d
you can choose any depending on readibility

implicitly everything written is a definition that can exist as an instance, it becomes an instance when its called by adding to memory MemoryAdd that can then be edited MemoryEdit, and read MemoryRead

implicitly all parts of the definitions are initialized, explictly you can initialize just parts (lines) by specifying it as function argument

functions can be called by Call

if x is y then z is pythonlike

the file calls the first call command

some containers can have arbitrary functions, if you call that container you get called whats inside

Functions imply some editable memory in its structure (class) context

Each Object has implicit string name in Object.Name

Like in python:
Function Live() is definition
Live() calls it
function types when called call line by line

Exists(x) checks if that thing exists in memory and returns boolean
